# Ray Tracer #

This is a really simple ray tracer, modelled after the book [Ray tracing in one weekend](http://in1weekend.blogspot.com/2016/01/ray-tracing-in-one-weekend.html)

It's not finished yet, right now it supports rendering diffuse shaded spheres, like this one: ![Shaded sphere](https://i.imgur.com/HkL93mi.jpg)
